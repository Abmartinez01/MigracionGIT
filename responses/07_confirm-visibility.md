## Private or Public?

Right now, your repository is set to {% if private %}private{% else %}public{% endif %}.

You can change the visibility of a repository to Private <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#private-repository)</sup> or Public at any time, but there are some things you should know.

### Private Repositories
If your repository is private, then the only people who can see your code are the collaborators <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#collaborator)</sup> that you've invited.

Private repositories also aren't free. The price depends on how many collaborators have access to any given repository, but the base price is $7 per month for unlimited private personal repositories.

You might want this repository to be private if it has sensitive information, or depending on the software's license.

### Public Repositories
In public repositories, anybody can see your code. All of the millions of open source repositories on GitHub are public, too!

Licenses, code of conduct, other files become even more important when the world can interact with you and your code. There are many benefits to this, but it's also a large responsibility. Keep in mind that once a repository is public _and_ open source, there are certain implications about keeping it public, depending on the license chosen.

> It's important to note that public does **not** equal open source! The license associated with code determines whether or not it is open source.
