- Learned what to do with an empty repo on GitHub :sparkles:
- Created a .gitignore and removed bulky binaries
- Used GitHub Importer for the first time
- Set your code up in a GitHub repository :fireworks:

## What's Next?

Now that you've migrated your Git repository to GitHub, managing your repository and adding collaborators are common next steps. Here are some recommended courses we think you might be interested in:

[Maintaining your GitHub project]({{ host }}/courses/maintaining-your-github-project)
Learn how to optimize your repository for collaboration. This course reviews the different steps you can take to make your open source project more welcoming to outside collaborators or make it easier for coworkers to contribute to your private project.

[Cultivating your community]({{ host }}/courses/cultivating-your-community)
Hosting a project on GitHub enables you to share your work with millions of other developers.
